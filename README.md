DynamicBar
==========

Javascript Project to create Dom Elements dynamically and provide Animation to those elements

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS AR AS FOLLOWS:

Dynamically creating form elements depending upon the answer of the last question

The form elements for the questionnaire MUST be elements

At least 2 choices for each selection

Al least a depth of 3 different questions 


Once the user has made their selections, (at least) create a new node to print out their final choices to the screen (Ex: You want a man with facial hair of slight build! That is minimal â€“ do more to do better!)

Give the user the option to start over at any time!

A form on some page getting the users information (validation!)

The use of Cookies & localStorage (possibly to hold the user information in the form?)

NO use visibility to show/hide the selections

Some use of DHTML (menu system, sliding elements, etc. animation preferred!)

No use of layout with tables! Everything done with CSS

No use of innerHTML! 

Include comments in the code to clearly explain functionality.

Re-direction of non-modern and Mac IE browsers ( Mac IE will pass document.getElementById), redirect the user to FireFox download page
